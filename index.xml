Data: The data is to be found at: https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/tree/master/00_data/network_krackhard (Hint: You neet to download the raw data) Data: What do I get? Background Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/info/01_infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/info/01_infrastructure/</guid><description>Material Datacamp: Get access to all the Datacamp premium content for free to facilitate your data science journey. Github Provides internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It is also commonly used to host open-source projects, including data science projects. If you do not have it already, you are advice to create an account to manage and showcase your work during this semester.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 - NLP</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/00_exercises/exercise2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/00_exercises/exercise2/</guid><description>Introduction: Building a Hate Speech Classifier This assignment is less structured than previous individual assignments.
You are given a collection of approximately 25k tweets that have been manually (human) annotated. class denotes: 0 - hate speech, 1 - offensive language, 2 - neither

1. Preprocessing and vectorizaion. Justify your choices and explain possible alternatives (e.g. removing stopwords, identifying bi/tri-grams, removing verbs or use of stemming, lemmatization etc.)
Create a bag-of-words representation, apply TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (LSA-topic modelling alternatively simply PCA or SVD) to transform your corpus into a feature matrix.</description></item><item><title>Intermediate Network Analysis</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/01_networks/2_networks_intermediate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/01_networks/2_networks_intermediate/</guid><description> Use the tabs to access content.

We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.
Main Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python.</description></item><item><title>NLP - Final Assignment</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/info/05_final_assignment_nlp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/UNISTRA-DS-2022/info/05_final_assignment_nlp/</guid><description>What to do? Outline a problem relevant within (evolutionary) economics, innovation studies, economic geography or related disciplines. Below some examples:
